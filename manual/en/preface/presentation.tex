\SEMFull\ \cite{Tellier_demo2012} is a free syntactic annotation software for French.\\

It allows raw text segmentation in tokens and sentences, but it can also take presegmented text as an input. Multiword entities can be handled two different ways: either as a single token where every subtoken is linked by the character '\_' or as multiple word tagged with the same syntactic category.\\

\SEM\ offers three levels of annotations. The first one is Part-Of-Speech using the tagset defined by \cite{Crabbe08}. The second one is a chunking annotation using IOB2 tagging scheme. Chunking can be complete or partial (only noun phrases). The third one is named entity recognition (NER) using the \cite{sagot2012annotation} tagset.\\
